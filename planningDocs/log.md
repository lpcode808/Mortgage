# Project Implementation Log

## 2025-02-14 22:37:01 HST - Initial Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Calculator Setup
Starting with the simplest possible implementation that provides value:

1. **Initial Structure:**
   - Single HTML file with embedded CSS/JS
   - Basic form inputs for core calculations
   - Simple styling with Bootstrap CDN
   - No build process needed initially
   - Easy to deploy to GitHub Pages

**Rationale:**
- Single HTML file approach allows for rapid prototyping
- No build complexity means faster iterations
- Bootstrap CDN provides immediate mobile-first responsive design
- GitHub Pages deployment is straightforward with static files
- Core calculation logic can be tested quickly

**Next Steps:**
1. Create basic `index.html` with Bootstrap setup
2. Implement core mortgage calculation function
3. Add basic form inputs (no sliders yet)
4. Add simple results display
5. Setup GitHub repository and test GitHub Pages deployment

This approach follows the "start small, win early" philosophy by:
- Getting core calculations working first
- Ensuring mobile responsiveness from day one
- Making deployment simple
- Allowing for easy testing and validation
- Providing a solid foundation for incremental improvements

Future phases will iteratively add:
- Sliders for better UX
- Custom expense items
- CSV export/import
- Educational tooltips
- Comparison features

Questions before proceeding:
1. Do you want to use any specific CSS framework other than Bootstrap?
2. Should we include any analytics from the beginning?
3. Do you have any specific preferences for code organization within the single file?

## 2025-02-14 22:41:32 HST - Implementation Decisions

Confirmed decisions:
- Will use Bootstrap via CDN for responsive design
- No analytics in initial implementation
- Code organization will be structured for future extensibility

**Code Organization Plan:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <!-- Meta, Title, Bootstrap CSS -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- HTML Structure -->
    <header>
        <!-- Title, Navigation (future) -->
    </header>
    
    <main>
        <!-- Calculator Form -->
        <!-- Results Display -->
    </main>

    <footer>
        <!-- Footer Content -->
    </footer>

    <!-- CSS Section -->
    <style>
        /* Core Styles */
        /* Form Styles */
        /* Results Styles */
        /* Responsive Adjustments */
    </style>

    <!-- JavaScript Section -->
    <script>
        // Constants and Configuration
        const CONFIG = {
            defaultValues: {},
            validationRules: {}
        };

        // Core Calculation Functions
        const mortgageCalculator = {
            calculateMonthlyPayment: () => {},
            calculateTotalInterest: () => {}
        };

        // UI Handler Functions
        const uiHandlers = {
            handleInputChange: () => {},
            updateResults: () => {}
        };

        // Utility Functions
        const utils = {
            formatCurrency: () => {},
            validateInput: () => {}
        };

        // Event Listeners and Initialization
        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
            // Setup code
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Next Action Items:**
1. Create initial `index.html` with this structure
2. Implement basic mortgage calculation function
3. Add form inputs and results display
4. Test locally
5. Setup GitHub repository

## 2025-02-14 22:44:57 HST - Feature Enhancement Plan

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features Implementation

**New Features to Add:**
1. Number Formatting Enhancement:
   - Add automatic formatting for numeric inputs (e.g., "100000" â†’ "100,000")
   - Maintain numeric validation while showing formatted display
   - Update all numeric inputs to use this enhancement

2. Custom Expense Items:
   - Add dynamic expense item addition/removal
   - Include name, amount, and frequency (monthly/annual) for each expense
   - Update total monthly calculation to include these expenses
   - Store expenses in the configuration

3. CSV Export/Import:
   - Add export button to download current calculator state
   - Implement import functionality for saved calculations
   - Include all custom expenses in the export/import

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Add input masking library (Cleave.js) for number formatting
2. Create dynamic expense management section
3. Implement CSV handling using built-in JavaScript features
4. Update UI to accommodate new features while maintaining mobile-first design

**Technical Considerations:**
- Use Cleave.js for input formatting (lightweight, well-maintained)
- Store custom expenses in an array within the calculator state
- Use FileReader API for CSV import
- Implement Blob API for CSV export
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing calculations

## 2025-02-14 22:49:44 HST - Bug Fix: Number Scaling in CSV Import/Export

**Issue Identified:**
- Numbers are being incorrectly scaled down by 1000x during CSV import/export
- Example: $500,000 is showing as $500
- Affects both mortgage values and custom expenses

**Root Cause:**
- Number parsing is not properly handling the formatted currency strings
- Need to properly strip currency formatting before parsing
- Need to maintain full numeric precision during import/export

**Fix Approach:**
1. Update number parsing to properly handle currency formatting
2. Ensure export uses raw numeric values instead of formatted strings
3. Add validation to prevent magnitude loss
4. Update CSV import to properly parse currency strings

**Implementation Details:**
- Add utility function for parsing currency strings
- Store raw numeric values in state
- Update CSV handlers to use raw values
- Add validation checks for reasonable value ranges

## 2025-02-14 22:55:06 HST - Feature Addition: Required Monthly Costs and Expense Breakdown

**New Features:**
1. Added Required Monthly Costs:
   - HOA fees field in main calculator
   - Insurance field in main calculator
   - These are common required expenses for Hawaii properties

2. Added Ranked Expense Breakdown:
   - Shows all monthly costs in descending order
   - Includes percentage of total monthly payment
   - Helps visualize cost distribution
   - Categories: Principal & Interest, HOA, Insurance, Custom Expenses

**Implementation Details:**
- Add new fields to main mortgage form
- Create new section for ranked breakdown
- Calculate percentages of total monthly payment
- Sort expenses by amount
- Include all costs in CSV export/import

## 2025-02-14 23:00:44 HST - UI Improvements: Layout and Property Identification

**New Features:**
1. Property Identification Fields:
   - Added nickname field for quick reference
   - Added address field for property location
   - Helps track multiple property calculations

2. Improved Form Layout:
   - Reorganized form into 2-column grid
   - Reduced vertical space usage
   - Better space utilization on larger screens
   - Maintained mobile responsiveness

**Implementation Details:**
- Use Bootstrap grid system for 2-column layout
- Add new fields to form and CSV export/import
- Update state management to include property details
- Maintain mobile-first approach (stack on small screens)
- Update CSV handlers to include new fields
